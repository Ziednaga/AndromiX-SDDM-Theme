AndromiX-SDDM-Theme is an SDDM theme fork based on the original Andromeda-KDE Plasma 6 project by Eliverlara, enhanced to bring a fresh, modern look to your login experience. This fork focuses on revamping the visual presentation of the SDDM login screen by offering:

## Revamped Digital Clock:
    
    The traditional digital clock has been replaced with a modern, 
    stylish variant, strategically positioned at the center-right of the screen for enhanced visibility and design.

## Enhanced Blur Effect:
    
    The background blur effect has been modified with a Nord-inspired tint, 
    creating a cool and elegant atmosphere that complements the overall aesthetics.

## Contemporary Aesthetic:
    
    With a clean and minimalist interface, AndromiX-SDDM-Theme blends functionality with attractive design, 
    making it ideal for users seeking a login experience that stands out for its modernity and refinement.

## Customizable Fork: 
    
    Built on Andromeda-KDE and ready to adapt to your personal preferences 
    modifying the main.qml or login.qml file.

This project is perfect for KDE users who want to personalize and modernize the appearance of their SDDM session manager without sacrificing the simplicity and usability of the original Andromeda-KDE SDDM Theme.

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Thank you for using AndromiX-KDE!
