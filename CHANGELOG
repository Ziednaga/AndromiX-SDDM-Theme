## [zReleased]

### Added
- **Modern right-center clock** 
  -classic clock disabled by default.
- **Background Blur Effect:**
  - Introduced a blur effect to the left 50% of the screen:
    - Implemented a clipped `Item` container to confine the blur area.
    - Added a `ShaderEffectSource` targeting the `wallpaper` as the source within the defined area.
    - Applied a `GaussianBlur` with a radius of 50 and 101 samples to achieve the desired blur intensity.
    - Overlaid a semi-transparent `Rectangle` with the Nord color `#3B4252` and 50% opacity to enhance visual aesthetics. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Light Theme Variant:**
  - Developed a light variant of the theme using Nord's light color palette:
    - Utilized colors from the Snow Storm palette (`#eceff4, #3B4252`) for backgrounds and UI elements. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    - Ensured consistency with Nord's design principles while providing a brighter interface option.
  -Still in beta.

### Changed
- **Z-Index Adjustments:**
  - Ensured UI elements such as user avatars, password fields, and action buttons are rendered above the blur effect:
    - Set the `z` property of the blur container and its children to -2.
    - Assigned a higher `z` value (e.g., 1) to the container holding the UI elements to maintain proper layering.

### Fixed
- **UI Element Visibility:**
  - Resolved an issue where UI components were not visible due to improper stacking order:
    - Adjusted the `z` values to ensure all interactive elements are displayed correctly above the background blur.
